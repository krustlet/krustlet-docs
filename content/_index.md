Krustlet has a lot of documentation. A high-level overview of how it’s organized
will help you know where to look for certain things:

- [The introduction]({{< relref "intro" >}}) takes you by the hand through a series of
  steps to run an application on Krustlet. Start here if you’re new to Krustlet.
- [Topic guides]({{< relref "topics" >}}) discuss key topics and concepts at a fairly
  high level and provide useful background information and explanation.
- [Community Guides]({{< relref "community" >}}) teach you about the development
  process for Krustlet and how you can contribute to the project.
- [How To Guides]({{< relref "howto" >}}) are recipes. They guide you through the steps
  involved in addressing key problems and use-cases. They are more advanced than
  tutorials and assume some knowledge of how Krustlet works.
